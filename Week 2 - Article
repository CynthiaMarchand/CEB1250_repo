I red this article: 
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-docker-can-help-you-become-a-more-effective-data-scientist-7fc048ef91d5

I found this article really usefull since I don't know anything about Docker. 
We used it in class, but I didn't really understand what we were doing, so this article is a really good start. 
One thing I found really interesting is the reproductible side of Docker. 
Being able to put everything (configuration files, drivers, operating systems, etc.) in a Docker container is a big advantage.
Also, I learnt about statements and what they are used for. I'm not sure I could use them now and completely understand what they do, but at least I know they exist!

Docker can be really usefull and I need to know how it works, even if now I feel like an extraterrestrial when I use Docker!
But at least, I will have this article I can refer to when I'll use Docker and try things with it.
